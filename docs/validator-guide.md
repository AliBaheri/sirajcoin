## Validator instructions

Running a validator is a huge responsibility. You need to know how to keep a server online with 100% uptime in a hostile environment. If that sounds scary, please let us know ASAP -- you don't have to do this!

## 1. Spin up a linux server

We recommend Digital Ocean on Ubuntu 16.04.3, but use whatever you want.

SSH into your server, then grab your ip:

```bash
$ curl ipinfo.io/ip
```

then tell us your ip in slack.
